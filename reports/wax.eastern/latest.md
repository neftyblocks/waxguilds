Promotion efforts on social media have successfully attracted new users to explore the WAX blockchain.  

**Translating and Sharing WAX Official Updates**  
   Official articles and project updates have been translated into Chinese and shared within the community, strengthening ties between WAX and its Chinese-speaking users.
