### <ins>Noteworthy</ins>

In order to improve the availability of our Hyperion query service, we have added a node to the Elasticsearch data cluster. Due to the large size of the current Mainnet database, nodes require time to synchronize replicas between them. Due to the overhead of shard rebalancing, Guilds monitors are intermittently showing timeout issues when accessing our Elasticsearch API. We hope that in the next few days all nodes in the cluster will have stabilized and these access issues will be resolved.

**Testnet**

In Testnet we have upgraded our Hyperion service to version 3.5 so that it can join the Hub service "QRY Network". For the moment we will only be testing with version 3.5 in Testnet until we have guarantees of stability.
