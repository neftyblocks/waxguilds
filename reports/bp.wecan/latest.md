Mostly reinforced our infra and consolidated a bunch of maintenance tasks in order to smoothly transition between hosting providers maintenances.

We also quickly assisted with Alcor's situation related to the stuck funds on EOS when the IBCs went down.

**Ecosystem Networking Engagement**

***Overview***

There was done some portion of effort and some resources were used to get more traction from the user base side.
This collaboration has helped us to attract new players and expand our social media presence to 60,000+ followers (ref. https://t.me/rplanetio) which created prositive influx to the WAX ecosystem.

***Two-Round Tournament***

The R-Planet Two-Round Tournament, with a ***$50,000 USD prize pool***, has been a highlight of our community engagement efforts. 
The first round, featuring 3 servers, has been completed, and the second round will take place on one server on November 26th. 
This tournament has created excitement among players and helped foster competition within the community.

Both events hopefully reflected on the WAX awareness side, since we had a really great volume gain from that due to increased demand of NFTs that are used in the gameplay.
