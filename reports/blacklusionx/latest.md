### Validationcore

**Update**:
- Maintenance
**Metrics**

Period:
- Upkeep
- Please notice that there were some networking issues with OVH from the night of the 19 - 20. November. Since our validationcore nodes are hosted at OVH, it has impacted some guild scores. Please keep this in mind to ensure a fair scoring of guilds.

Stats: Not tracked, but it is safe to say the validationcore is an essential part of the OIG evaluations itself :)

### OneApi

**URLs**: https://wax.oneapi.dev/v1/chain/get_info

**List of SCs**: -

**Update**:
- Upkeep
- This month we have worked quite a lot on a new documentation page, as currently oneapi.dev does not show anything. We wanted that the user can try out the api request directly in the browser. For this we have combined all the OpenApi schemas from Chain, Hyperion and Atomic. As of right now it is currently hosted on vercel, as we had some issues with the cloudflare pages. But we will point it to wax.oneapi.dev and oneapi.dev in the next days.

**Update**: Operational

**Metrics**

Period: 25. October 2024 - 25. November 2024

Stats: 14 (6 more than last time) subscribers. The number by itself, does not sound impressive, but keep in mind that this tool is targeted towards guild operators. Taking this into account, a decent percentage of all guilds use the bot to monitor their infrastructure.
