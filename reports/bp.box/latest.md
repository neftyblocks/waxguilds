**List of SCs**: ram.defi

**Update**: 
We heard from WAX OIG that WAX RAM inflation has been stopped for a while and experienced some price pump recently. We think Defibox RAM trading platform will contribute a lot to WAX system. We are already evaluating it whether it worth it or not. We haven't found any WAX RAM trading tools except "EOS authority", and it is very rough. Defibox can provide a professional RAM trading tools.
The RAM wave on EOS has been continuing for a while. On EOS, we have BRAM, WRAM, RAMS, RAMX, etc. all based on RAM. Among them, the most popular RAM tokenization is "BRAM". And Defibox RAM trading platform is the most visited website for RAM traders. Both are very good products from Defibox. We recently noticed in the WAX governance group talking about WAX version RAM. Our group internally evaluate our RAM product and see the possibility of bringing it to the WAX if the WAX ecosystem have some RAM fever in the future, Defibox could be a good RAM builders also on WAX.
