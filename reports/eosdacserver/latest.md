##### Unity SDK for Mobile
At Alien Worlds, open-source is a key pillar for the longevity and success of our metaverse. We’ve seen this come to life through the recently completed [Unity SDK for mobile](https://github.com/double-coconut/coconut-wax/tree/master), developed by Double Coconut, the creators of Milky Way Miner. This Unity SDK is a significant contribution to the entire WAX ecosystem, allowing any developer to provide a better user experience for mobile players by supporting in-game transactions of NFTs and fungible tokens. Open-source initiatives like this are important because they democratize access to powerful tools, fostering innovation and improvement of the Alien Worlds metaverse.

##### Mercenary Battle Grounds
Mercenary Battleground is a captivating strategy game that challenges players to defend their base against waves of enemy forces. Set in a fantasy world, the game offers a unique blend of tower defense and real-time strategy gameplay.
Mercenary Battlegrounds has been enriched through the support of the Galactic Hubs grant program. The grant’s development introduces a unique feature: the ability to stake specific Alien Worlds NFTs—such as the Grey Peacemaker, Enhanced Reptiloid, and Wise Ancient One. When staked, these NFTs become playable towers, each bringing its own strategic advantage to defend against the onslaught of enemy forces. This innovative integration adds an extra layer of depth and strategy, allowing players to leverage their Alien Worlds NFT collection directly within the game.
