### <ins>Noteworthy</ins>
Hyperion ES Snapshots are now hosted out of Perth and Canada. 

No outages were experienced this last period however we have been experimenting with SHIP failover on our WAX Testnet Hyperion Full history, so there were a few blips.

HeadsUp v0.1.7 will be release this week.

Be sure to check out the public showcase of HeadsUp to get a feel for the platforms capability here -> https://headsup.eosphere.io/

We are provisioning a new AMD EPYC server in Sydney, hopefully we can do more with less physical hardware.

Perth servers are having their RAM and DISKs upgraded, our Dell 740xd's will have 1TB of RAM.
