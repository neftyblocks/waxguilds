We have been continuing work on our metrics tool and updated waxport. We also created a new script to test the speeds of snapshot providers to save time deploying new nodes.

Qaraqol Metrics:

**List of SCs**:  N/A

**Update**: 
Our main focus as a guild these past few weeks has been working on providing metrics/analytics for the WAX chain. We have fixed some of the issues with the Bridge Analytics/Powerup Fees/CPU Metrics and also expanded greatly upon the Inflation Metrics. 6 new metrics has been added in total
focusing on chain inflation. We created a "Real Inflation" metric, tracking how much inflation is actually put into circulation from system inflation accounts in WAX and percent form. We also created a metric tracking what accounts earn the most from staking rewards plus some other useful metrics 
regarding total wax in circulation.

Snapshot Speed Test: 

**URLs**
https://github.com/qaraqol/wax-snapshots-speedtest

**Update**: 
We developed a script to automatically discover and test the download speeds of WAX snapshot providers. The script supports multiple snapshot file types, generates detailed speed reports with rankings, and intelligently finds and tests snapshot providers download speeds. In our tests, our tool could offer
up to 20-30% faster download times, which really adds up and saves time when downloading a 4 terabyte blocks log for example.
