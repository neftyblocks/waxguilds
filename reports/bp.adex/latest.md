### <ins>Feedback to OIG</ins>

1. Same issue with missing communication with WAX Team, multiple emails were send, but still no reply for months.

2. Our guild would like to support splitting initiative by TechOps and Products guilds, currently too much funds and time spent on not used infrastructure and nothing granted for products.

3. We do not agree for granting zero points for WAX Signals product, members reached to 20 and show some interest. Also we are using Thalos for real time processing, but Telegram API rate limits are pretty low so we will not track all transactions. If nothing will change to grant something for products, even small amount(Â±300-500$), it will lead to discontinue and shut down the products.
